Just starting off this awesome blog. 
I've got everything migrated over, and I was able to delete my old hosting account! 

Check out this GitHub repo to see how this site is put together using GitHub Pages / Jekyll: [mmacomber0.github.io](https://github.com/mmacomber0/mmacomber0.github.io).

It is wonderfully simple, and more importantly, free!
