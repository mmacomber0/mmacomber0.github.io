**State Trip #8: South Carolina ‚úàÔ∏è**

<!--more-->

My wife and I are trying to spend a week in each US state. We do about 2 or 3 a year. 

Next up is South Carolina! I've only ever driven through this state, but it looks to offer quite a lot. 
- We'll spend some days in coastal towns, feasting on seafood. 
- We'll make our way inland towards the Appalachian mountains for some hiking, waterfalls, and outdoor beauty. 
- We'll stop in a few cities to enjoy public art, restaurants, markets, etc. 

We'll be there in the fall, so I'm excited to enjoy some cooler weather as well. 

Check out the map below for some of the stuff we plan on doing. We always plan backups, so don't hold me to any of these! üòÅ
