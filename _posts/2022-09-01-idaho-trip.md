**Stuff I'm doing in Idaho ✈️**

<!--more-->

My wife and I are trying to spend a week in each US state. We do about 2 or 3 a year. 

Next up—and I'm not fully sure why—is Idaho! It looks to be a beautiful state with loads of fun things to do outdoors.

Check out the map below for some of the stuff we plan on doing.
